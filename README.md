# Two-Sum-Problem

You need to find two numbers in the array that add up to the target integer.

# Notes

The solution provided is brute force approach, an alterative approach might use a hash map, however we would have to assume all numbers in array are > 0.

The time complexity is

total = n \* (time(statement1) + n \* time(statment2))

if we ignore the constants the time complexity is O(n^2)
